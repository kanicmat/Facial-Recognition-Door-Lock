# Facial-Recognition-Door-Lock
This project examines the relationship between Arduino hardware, Java programming, and facial recognition through the Firmata and OpenCV libraries and its ability to create systems to enhance security, demonstrated in this project of locks controlled by facial recognition. The code uses a multitude of libraries to create graphs, create array lists, recognize faces, and most importantly create connections with the Arduino.


Technical Requirements/Specifications: 
The system should be able to unlock the door when a face is recognized by the camera. Additionally, it should be able to communicate the unlocking of the door to the user by turning on the LED and displaying a message to the terminal window in IntelliJ. Similarly, the system should be able to lock the door when a face is no longer recognized, and as well communicate this to the users by turning off the LED and displaying a message in the terminal window in IntelliJ. The system should also throw an exception if there is an error with facial recognition or any other aspect of the program. The system also relies on the use of state machines to determine when, why, and how the Arduino communicates with the Arduino to perform its tasks and provide the proper information to the user. The libraries, JFreeChart, Firmata4j, OpenCV all contain suitable APIs for this program because Firmata4j establishes the connection with the Arduino board, JFreeChart encourages proper analysis and gives a graphical representation of the efficiency of the control of the lock, and OpenCV allows for facial recognition of any face as long as the proper files are downloaded and referenced in the code. To deal with events, the system uses conditional statements that rely on the camera to recognize faces and determine when to lock and unlock the door, turn on or off the LED, and which message to display. If a face is recognized, the checks if the door is locked, if it is the door is unlocked, and the user is notified with the LED turning on and with a message display. On the other hand, if a face is not recognized the door is locked, the LED turns off, and a message is displayed for the user. Similarly to the main project, I used an array list to collect the converted values of the rotary sensor values to then be passed to the InitateGraph class where it will be plotted on a graph of the sensor value Vs. time.
